          <p>Our Personalised Investment Management Service enables you to delegate responsibility for managing your investments to Strategiq. Your dedicated investment manager will work with you to build a bespoke investment portfolio that is designed to meet your investment objectives. Your investment manager will then take responsibility for the day-to-day decision-making on your portfolio, deciding which investments to buy or sell, and when to do so.</p>
          <p>Every client has a unique set of aims, objectives and circumstances. Your investment manager will always begin by working with you or your financial adviser to identify a set of achievable investment goals that take into account your investment time horizon, your attitude to investment risk and the investment returns you require. Together you will review your options and decide on the best way to achieve your objectives.</p>
          <p>We believe asset allocation is a primary determinant of long-term investment performance. As a framework for constructing your portfolio we use a range of asset allocation strategies that have been determined by our Asset Allocation Committee. Your investment manager will then fine-tune your allocation to meet your exact requirements before selecting the investments held within each asset class.</p>
          <p>Your investment manager will ensure your portfolio always reflects our core views and remains on target to meet your personal objectives. Our managers are supported by our independent team of research analysts who conduct formal monitoring and due diligence of assets, to ensure that your portfolio is invested across what we believe is the best range of investment options.</p>
