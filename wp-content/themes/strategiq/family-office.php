                <h1>Our Purpose</h1>
            </div>
            <p>A family office acts as a private management team to wealthy families, with a dedicated team of professional advisers who oversee clients' complete financial affairs.</p>
            <p>An investment committee is established comprising of 3-5 members (family members, outside advisors & investment professionals). The committee meets on a semi-annual basis with actionable agendas circulated in advance, formalising the management process. </p>
            <p>A family mission statement or policy statement provides a framework for the family to "buy into" the investment strategy. The Investment Committee has numerous responsibilities including asset allocation, fund manager selection and the review of overall investment performance.</p>
