The collapse of oil prices has left many market participants shell-shocked and has certainly contributed to fears of a global slow down. Towards the end of the week supportive comments from both Chinese and  European policymakers managed to stem the doom and gloom prospects.\r\n\r\nGlobal and local markets continued to be whipsawed with most markets experiencing a net gain over the week. Key focus areas for the week ahead include US earnings season (so far S&amp;P 500 has beat EPS by 6.5% and the earnings surprise ratio remains positively skewed) and locally the first meeting of the MPC (Monetary Policy Committee).\r\n\r\nAs always we welcome any feedback on our Weekly Review.','$96 per barrel','','publish','open','open','','96-per-barrel','','','2016-04-04 19:58:08','2016-04-04 18:58:08','',0,'http://strategiq.co.za/?p=26',0,'post','',0),

The collapse of oil prices has left many market participants shell-shocked and has certainly contributed to fears of a global slow down. Towards the end of the week supportive comments from both Chinese and  European policymakers managed to stem the doom and gloom prospects.\r\n\r\nGlobal and local markets continued to be whipsawed with most markets experiencing a net gain over the week. Key focus areas for the week ahead include US earnings season (so far S&amp;P 500 has beat EPS by 6.5% and the earnings surprise ratio remains positively skewed) and locally the first meeting of the MPC (Monetary Policy Committee).\r\n\r\nAs always we welcome any feedback on our Weekly Review.','$96 per barrel','','inherit','closed','closed','','26-revision-v1','','','2016-04-04 19:51:14','2016-04-04 18:51:14','',26,'http://strategiq.co.za/26-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),

Approximately 40% of the jobs created are rated as low-wage jobs.\r\n\r\nLocally, the JSE All Share index ended the week flat, the listed property sector was negatively impacted by the spike in bond yields following the continued uncertainty in the Finance Ministers future and the “halting” of loans to state owned enterprises by Futuregrowth (an asset manager in the Old Mutual stable).\r\n\r\nThis continuing battle between the ruling party leadership and the finance ministry is having a significant economic impact on an already struggling domestic economy. The stakes couldn’t be higher and we expect this period to continue to be volatile, especially for the rand.\r\n\r\nIn the US the focus was on whether the Federal Reserve would consider the August nonfarm payrolls to be strong enough to raise interest rates, which it can do as early as its September meeting. Whilst there was little in the report to spur the Fed to hike rates at the September meeting it reinforced that the US economic recovery continues to move along.\r\n\r\nThe Nikkei had a strong week on the back of a weakening yen.\r\n\r\nEuropean markets ended the week stronger, spurred by a lower for longer interest rate outlook from across the Atlantic. The U.K.\'s benchmark FTSE 100 index closed around 2.6 percent higher. The France\'s CAC ended 2.4 percent higher, while the German DAX was up 1.4 percent.','Weaker US Jobs Data','','inherit','closed','closed','','210-revision-v1','','','2016-09-03 11:56:03','2016-09-03 09:56:03','',210,'http://strategiq.co.za/210-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),

Combined with the other four most recent national polls, Clinton enjoys a 5% lead entering the final hours of the campaign.

The yield curve has steepened as a result.\r\n\r\nWhen the yield curve steepens, the gap between the yields on short-term bonds and long-term bonds increases, making the curve appear \"steeper.“ A steepening yield curve typically indicates investor expectations for 1) rising inflation and 2) stronger economic growth.\r\n\r\nThe JSE All-Share index ended the week 3,34% higher, with 4,89% gains in financial shares and 3,68% gains in industrial shares.\r\n\r\nThe rand was trading at R13.81 to the US dollar, R17.39 to the British pound and R14.59 to the euro. Gold had given up 1,34%, while Brent crude was flat over the week trading at $54 a barrel.\r\n\r\nAsian markets ended the week strongly with the Nikkei over 3% higher after the European Central Bank decided to extend its bond buying programme beyond March.

The British FTSE 100 advancing to end the week up 3.32%.\r\n\r\nIn the U.S. stocks followed higher on the week with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 up over 3%. As the new Trump administration and Congress take office in January, proposed changes in government policies dominate the outlook for 2017. Stock prices, interest rates and the value of the U.S. dollar have risen since the election due to optimism about likely pro-growth policies.\r\n\r\nNext week, the Federal Reserve (Fed) is expected to raise short-term interest rates for the second time in the current expansion on Wednesday.

Moody’s cited poor economic growth and political infighting as two major contributors to a lower rating.\r\n\r\nIn our chart of the week (click below) we summarise SA’s local currency and foreign currency debt ratings from the respective rating agencies. The key risk that has been averted for now remains that SA’s local currency credit rating is downgraded one more notch by either S&amp;P or Moody’s triggering a junk status on local currency bonds. This will force a significant outflow out of SA local currency bonds held by foreign investors (estimated R120 Billion outflow).\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, following the Cabinet reshuffle where President Jacob Zuma replaced former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan with former Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba, the ratings agency placed South Africa on review for a downgrade. At the time both Fitch and S&amp;P downgraded the foreign currency rating to junk status.\r\n\r\nThe JSE All-Share index (-1,27%) ended the week weaker led by losses in Industrials (-1,90%) and Financials (-2,40%).

Moody’s cited poor economic growth and political infighting as two major contributors to a lower rating.\r\n\r\nIn our chart of the week (click below) we summarise SA’s local currency and foreign currency debt ratings from the respective rating agencies. The key risk that has been averted for now remains that SA’s local currency credit rating is downgraded one more notch by either S&amp;P or Moody’s triggering a junk status on local currency bonds. This will force a significant outflow out of SA local currency bonds held by foreign investors (estimated R120 Billion outflow).\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, following the Cabinet reshuffle where President Jacob Zuma replaced former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan with former Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba, the ratings agency placed South Africa on review for a downgrade. At the time both Fitch and S&amp;P downgraded the foreign currency rating to junk status.\r\n\r\nThe JSE All-Share index (-1,27%) ended the week weaker led by losses in Industrials (-1,90%) and Financials (-2,40%).

	(488,2,'2017-06-26 15:52:05','2017-06-26 13:52:05','It’s been 22 years since South African’s were first allowed to invest their savings offshore. Since then, there has been a dramatic change in how much money we are legally allowed to transfer overseas.\r\n\r\nFor example, 17 years ago, individuals were only entitled to a lifetime allowance of R750 000, requiring a tax clearance. As of March 2015, anyone can take up to R11 million out of the country every calendar year. (R1 million discretionary allowance, not requiring any tax clearance). Effectively, this means that for the vast majority of South African resident’s exchange controls are no longer an issue and international investment markets are open to South Africans.\r\n\r\nAs South Africans one of the primary reasons for investing internationally is to hedge against socio-economic issues and political risk, the so-called “Zimbabwe” scenario. Whilst these are real risks that investors should consider, we highlight several other reasons to consider offshore investments.\r\n<h4>Reason 1: Access to a much wider investment universe</h4>\r\nThe South African Stock Market (JSE) accounts for approximately 1% of the global stock market (greater than $70 trillion). Investing offshore widens your investment universe to roughly 15 000 listed companies globally while the JSE has just over 400 listed companies. Investing offshore also offers access to global growth sectors like IT (with specialist sub-sectors like semi-conductors) and pharmaceuticals which are either not available on the JSE or have limited investment opportunities.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_490\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"641\" class=\"middle center \"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-490\" src=\"http://strategiq.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Picture1.jpg\" alt=\"“The JSE only accounts for 1% of global market capitalisation of $74.8 trillion”\" width=\"641\" height=\"149\" /> The JSE only accounts for 1% of global market capitalisation of $74.8 trillion[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Reason 2: SA market is extremely concentrated</h4>\r\nThe top 20 listed companies on the South African stock market represent almost 70% of the overall market capitalization (size) of the entire market. The performance of the top 20 shares therefore dominates the All Share Index returns. Naspers alone accounts for approximately 17% of the All Share Index. This high concentration to few counters increases the risk of a locally invested investment portfolio.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_497\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"247\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-497\" src=\"http://strategiq.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Picture2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"247\" height=\"204\" /> Investing offshore reduces concentration risk[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Reason 3: To match future ‘hard’ currency expenses</h4>\r\nWhilst currency movements can be extremely unpredictable, fundamentally the rand is expected to weaken over time due to the inflation differential between South Africa and its major trading partners.  Over the past 20 years, the rand has depreciated against the US Dollar by 200% (5,6% p.a.); illustrated by the gold trendline in the chart below.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if you want to retire overseas or travel extensively, you have investments to meet future liabilities. This would also apply to children or grandchildren who might want to be educated overseas.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_502\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"728\"]<img class=\"wp-image-502 size-full\" src=\"http://strategiq.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Picture3-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"728\" height=\"433\" /> Over the past 20 years, the rand has depreciated by 5.6% on an annualised basis relative to the USD[/caption]\r\n<h4>Reason 4: Currency creates an additional source of return</h4>\r\nTraditionally, sources of equity returns are (1) earnings growth, (2) dividend yield and (3) market rating. Currency exposure creates a 4<sup>th</sup> source of return (and risk). Depreciation of the rand and the earnings growth have been the most significant sources of return over all these periods. Currency has therefore been an important contributor to return. As per the chart below, rand depreciation has been a significant contributor to overall return of the MSCI World Index over three, five and ten years, whilst rand strength has been a detractor over a one year period.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_505\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"944\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-505\" src=\"http://strategiq.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Picture4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"944\" height=\"419\" /> Currency has been a significant contributor to long-term performance[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Reason 5:  Diversification mitigates risk</h4>\r\nAn investor can reduce portfolio risk simply by holding combinations of securities or assets that are not perfectly positively correlated. In other words, investors can reduce their exposure to risk by holding a diversified portfolio (allocating between assets and/or diversifying among securities). Diversification allows for the same expected return with reduced risk.\r\n\r\nAs a South African you are exposed to the SA economy, the consumer and local economics, when these are under pressure there may be other parts of the world with brighter economic prospects.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_507\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<img class=\"wp-image-507 size-full\" src=\"http://strategiq.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Picture5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"255\" /> As the saying goes: \"Don’t put all your eggs in one basket\"[/caption]\r\n\r\nIn summary once you have made the logical decision to invest offshore, one needs to decide how much to allocate offshore and the optimal investment strategy to follow. How much should one allocate offshore? Does one take funds physically offshore or make use of asset swap funds? How are the funds held, in one’s name, through a life wrapper or in an offshore Trust? There are many questions to answer, ensure you find the right financial experts to help you make the right choices.','5 additional reasons why you should invest internationally','','publish','open','open','','5-additional-reasons-why-you-should-invest-internationally','','','2017-06-27 12:25:54','2017-06-27 10:25:54','',0,'http://strategiq.co.za/?p=488',0,'post','',0),

Currency exposure creates a 4<sup>th</sup> source of return (and risk). Depreciation of the rand and the earnings growth have been the most significant sources of return over all these periods. Currency has therefore been an important contributor to return. As per the chart below, rand depreciation has been a significant contributor to overall return of the MSCI World Index over three, five and ten years, whilst rand strength has been a detractor over a one year period.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_505\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"944\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-505\" src=\"http://strategiq.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Picture4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"944\" height=\"419\" /> Currency has been a significant contributor to long-term performance[/caption]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Reason 5:  Diversification mitigates risk</strong>\n\nAn investor can reduce portfolio risk simply by holding combinations of securities or assets that are not perfectly positively correlated. In other words, investors can reduce their exposure to risk by holding a diversified portfolio (allocating between assets and/or diversifying among securities). Diversification allows for the same expected return with reduced risk.\n\nAs a South African you are exposed to the SA economy, the consumer and local economics, when these are under pressure there may be other parts of the world with brighter economic prospects.','5 additional reasons why you should invest internationally','','inherit','closed','closed','','488-autosave-v1','','','2017-06-26 16:55:42','2017-06-26 14:55:42','',488,'http://strategiq.co.za/488-autosave-v1/',0,'revision','',0),

This high concentration to few counters increases the risk of a locally invested investment portfolio.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_497\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"247\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-497\" src=\"http://strategiq.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Picture2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"247\" height=\"204\" /> Investing offshore reduces concentration risk[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Reason 3: To match future ‘hard’ currency expenses</h4>\r\nWhilst currency movements can be extremely unpredictable, fundamentally the rand is expected to weaken over time due to the inflation differential between South Africa and its major trading partners.  Over the past 20 years, the rand has depreciated against the US Dollar by 200% (5,6% p.a.); illustrated by the gold trendline in the chart below.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if you want to retire overseas or travel extensively, you have investments to meet future liabilities. This would also apply to children or grandchildren who might want to be educated overseas.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_502\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"728\"]<img class=\"wp-image-502 size-full\" src=\"http://strategiq.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Picture3-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"728\" height=\"433\" /> Over the past 20 years, the rand has depreciated by 5.6% on an annualised basis relative to the USD[/caption]\r\n<h4>Reason 4: Currency creates an additional source of return</h4>\r\nTraditionally, sources of equity returns are (1) earnings growth, (2) dividend yield and (3) market rating. Currency exposure creates a 4<sup>th</sup> source of return (and risk). Depreciation of the rand and the earnings growth have been the most significant sources of return over all these periods. Currency has therefore been an important contributor to return. As per the chart below, rand depreciation has been a significant contributor to overall return of the MSCI World Index over three, five and ten years, whilst rand strength has been a detractor over a one year period.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_505\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"944\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-505\" src=\"http://strategiq.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Picture4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"944\" height=\"419\" /> Currency has been a significant contributor to long-term performance[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Reason 5:  Diversification mitigates risk</h4>\r\nAn investor can reduce portfolio risk simply by holding combinations of securities or assets that are not perfectly positively correlated. In other words, investors can reduce their exposure to risk by holding a diversified portfolio (allocating between assets and/or diversifying among securities). Diversification allows for the same expected return with reduced risk.\r\n\r\nAs a South African you are exposed to the SA economy, the consumer and local economics, when these are under pressure there may be other parts of the world with brighter economic prospects.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_507\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<img class=\"wp-image-507 size-full\" src=\"http://strategiq.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Picture5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"255\" /> As the saying goes: \"Don’t put all your eggs in one basket\"[/caption]\r\n\r\nIn summary once you have made the logical decision to invest offshore, one needs to decide how much to allocate offshore and the optimal investment strategy to follow. How much should one allocate offshore? Does one take funds physically offshore or make use of asset swap funds? How are the funds held, in one’s name, through a life wrapper or in an offshore Trust? There are many questions to answer, ensure you find the right financial experts to help you make the right choices.','5 additional reasons why you should invest internationally','','inherit','closed','closed','','488-revision-v1','','','2017-06-26 17:06:12','2017-06-26 15:06:12','',488,'http://strategiq.co.za/488-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),

The strong week of trading was a result of weaker US CPI data and the suspension of the mining charter. This led to a stronger rand and a more positive environment for mining stocks. Over the week, the rand appreciated by 2.78% relative to the dollar.\r\n\r\nIn the week ahead, markets will turn to SA inflation and interest rate numbers, which will impact the financial and retail sectors.\r\n\r\nGlobal markets ended the week stronger as second quarter earnings season commences. The Dow Jones (+1.04%), S&amp;P 500 (+1.41%), NASDAQ (+2.59%), STOXX 600 (+1.75%) and FTSE 100 (+0.37%) all ended the week stronger. We expect earnings to continue to rise at a solid, albeit slower, pace through the remainder of the year, as sales are helped by the synchronized global rebound in economic growth and as cost controls remain tight.\r\n\r\nThe technology-heavy NASDAQ ended the week +2.6% higher, its best week since December, after a rebound in technology stocks. Amazon (+2.36%) and Alphabet (+3.84%) were some of the technology large caps to add gains to the index.\r\n\r\nCommodities all ended the week stronger amid gains in Gold (+1.49%), Iron Ore (+3.29%), Platinum (+2.20%) and the Brent Crude (4.71%).\r\n\r\nIn company news, Swedish carmaker<em> Volvo </em>this week moved the motor industry closer to an electric future, by announcing that from 2019, it would only produce pure electric and hybrid cars.\r\n\r\nGlobal sales of electric cars amounted to less than 1% of the market last year, but are expected to grow rapidly. US electric car start-up Tesla confounded motor industry expectations in 2016 by taking nearly 400,000 orders for its $35,000 Model 3 car. General Motors will launch ten electric models by 2020, and Toyota announced its ambition to mass-produce them by 2020.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Market Moves of the Week:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_549\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"495\"]<img class=\"wp-image-549 size-full\" src=\"http://strategiq.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Picture4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"495\" height=\"519\" /> <em>Source: Thomson Reuters</em>[/caption]\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Chart of the Week:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_552\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"680\"]<img class=\"wp-image-552 size-full\" src=\"http://strategiq.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/1111-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" /> This chart represents the impact that market timing can have on a portfolios annualised performance between the years 1995 - 2017 (5468 trading days).

We expect earnings to continue to rise at a solid, albeit slower, pace through the remainder of the year, as sales are helped by the synchronized global rebound in economic growth and as cost controls remain tight.\n\nThe technology-heavy NASDAQ ended the week +2.6% higher, its best week since December, after a rebound in technology stocks.

US electric car start-up Tesla confounded motor industry expectations in 2016 by taking nearly 400,000 orders for its $35,000 Model 3 car. General Motors will launch ten electric models by 2020, and Toyota announced its ambition to mass-produce them by 2020.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Market Moves of the Week:</strong></p>\n\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_549\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"495\"]<img class=\"wp-image-549 size-full\" src=\"http://strategiq.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Picture4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"495\" height=\"519\" /> <em>Source: Thomson Reuters</em>[/caption]\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Chart of the Week:</strong></p>\n\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_552\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"680\"]<img class=\"wp-image-552 size-full\" src=\"http://strategiq.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/1111-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" /> This chart represents the impact that market timing can have on a portfolios annualised performance between the years 1995 - 2017 (5468 trading days).

The strong week of trading was a result of weaker US CPI data and the suspension of the mining charter. This led to a stronger rand and a more positive environment for mining stocks. Over the week, the rand appreciated by 2.78% relative to the dollar.\r\n\r\nIn the week ahead, markets will turn to SA inflation and interest rate numbers, which will impact the financial and retail sectors.\r\n\r\nGlobal markets ended the week stronger as second quarter earnings season commences. The Dow Jones (+1.04%), S&amp;P 500 (+1.41%), NASDAQ (+2.59%), STOXX 600 (+1.75%) and FTSE 100 (+0.37%) all ended the week stronger. We expect earnings to continue to rise at a solid, albeit slower, pace through the remainder of the year, as sales are helped by the synchronized global rebound in economic growth and as cost controls remain tight.\r\n\r\nThe technology-heavy NASDAQ ended the week +2.6% higher, its best week since December, after a rebound in technology stocks. Amazon (+2.36%) and Alphabet (+3.84%) were some of the technology large caps to add gains to the index.\r\n\r\nCommodities all ended the week stronger amid gains in Gold (+1.49%), Iron Ore (+3.29%), Platinum (+2.20%) and the Brent Crude (4.71%).\r\n\r\nIn company news, Swedish carmaker<em> Volvo </em>this week moved the motor industry closer to an electric future, by announcing that from 2019, it would only produce pure electric and hybrid cars.\r\n\r\nGlobal sales of electric cars amounted to less than 1% of the market last year, but are expected to grow rapidly. US electric car start-up Tesla confounded motor industry expectations in 2016 by taking nearly 400,000 orders for its $35,000 Model 3 car. General Motors will launch ten electric models by 2020, and Toyota announced its ambition to mass-produce them by 2020.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Market Moves of the Week:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_549\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"495\"]<img class=\"wp-image-549 size-full\" src=\"http://strategiq.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Picture4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"495\" height=\"519\" /> <em>Source: Thomson Reuters</em>[/caption]\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Chart of the Week:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_552\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"680\"]<img class=\"wp-image-552 size-full\" src=\"http://strategiq.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/1111-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" /> This chart represents the impact that market timing can have on a portfolios annualised performance between the years 1995 - 2017 (5468 trading days).

Resources ended the week 1.89% weaker.\r\n\r\nThe two talking points for the week were the SA inflation and interest rate numbers. Firstly,  SA CPI dipped to 5.1% year-on-year in June, a decrease of 0.3% from the previous CPI number. This is the lowest SA inflation has been since November 2015. Secondly, the South African Reserve Bank cut its key rate by 25 basis points, to 6.75%. This is the first time in the last five years that the SA central bank has cut borrowing costs. The decision was made on the back of the lower inflation numbers and the slow growth the SA economy faces.\r\n\r\nLocal retail stocks gained momentum over the week as the lower inflation numbers and interest rate cut put investor confidence back into the sector. Truworths (+7.04%), The Foschini Group (+7.43%) and Mr Price (+5.36%) were some of the retailers that benefited from the economic news.\r\n\r\nGlobal markets had a mixed week of returns.

The Euro strengthened after the ECB left rates unchanged.\r\n\r\nIn other news, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has posted his first Instagram video: drone footage of Blue Origin\'s New Glenn rocket production facility. The video ends with the CEO on the roof holding a sign saying \"ROCKET FACTORY COMING SOON\". Blue Origin is Jeff Bezos\'s play at sending people to space at relatively low costs.

On a full year basis, revenue grew 6% and diluted earnings per share increased 16% to $2.51/share. Results for the quarter came in above the markets expectations. Analyst consensus called for revenue of $8.63bn and $0.50 per share for the quarter, while reported revenue and earnings per share for the quarter were $8.68bn and $0.60 respectively.\r\n\r\nFootwear and apparel had the largest gains in revenue over the year with footwear climbing 6.09% to $21.01bn and apparel grew 6.47% to $9.65bn. Together footwear and apparel account for over 89% of the company’s revenue. Geographically, Greater China and Japan displayed the strongest top line growth of 11.94% and 16.69% respectively.\r\n\r\nTwo key themes have been identified as playing a vital role in Nike’s growth going forward. The themes are the following:\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li>Partnerships and Direct-to-consumer (DTC): Just recently Nike announced partnerships with both Amazon and Instagram. Nike will use Instagram-style posts to start selling their products directly through Instagram. Nike will also offer a product range on Amazon. These both benefit Nike as it opens them up to millions of more potential customers on both Amazon and Instagram as well as allowing Nike to leverage off Amazon’s distribution channels. Both partnerships tie into Nike’s effort to improve DTC revenue. This form of revenue tries to get products directly to the consumer in the most efficient way possible. An example of a DTC initiative paying dividends is a 30% increase in digital commerce sales for the period.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li value=\"2\">International Growth: Nike are continuing to expand internationally. This both diversifies their consumers and allows them to hedge the currency by earning in multiple countries.

It is anticipated that the listing will be complete by the end of September, subject to market conditions. The African retail brands included in the Listing will comprise Pep in South Africa and the rest of Africa, Ackermans, Speciality division (comprising Dunns, John Craig, Refinery and Shoe City), JD Group (comprising Russells, Bradlows, Rochester, Sleepmasters, Incredible Connection and Hi-Fi Corporation), Steinbuild, Poco South Africa and Tekkie Town (the “African Assets”).\r\n\r\nThe rand fell to a new three-week low against the dollar on Friday as strong U.S. jobs data coupled with local economic and political risks dented investors\' appetite for the currency. The rand, trading at its weakest levels since July 12, has this week also been hit by fears of a third credit rating downgrade to \"junk\" ahead of review by Moody\'s on Aug. 11.\r\n\r\nThe market was also cautious ahead of a vote on a motion of no-confidence in President Jacob Zuma on Aug. 8. If the motion succeeds, Zuma and his entire cabinet would have to step down.\r\n\r\nOn the bourse, stocks ended higher with JSE All-Share index ending the week 1.93% stronger amid gains in Resources (+3.03%), Financials (+2.33%) and Industrials (+1.53%).\r\n\r\nIn the US, the stock market continues its positive momentum, as most of the companies reported better-than-expected earnings in the second quarter. On Wednesday, The Dow Jones climbed above 22,000 for the first time and closed at a record high on Friday.\r\n\r\nThe economic backdrop also remained positive as the economy added 209,000 jobs in July, higher than the expected 180,000, according to Bloomberg. The unemployment rate dropped to 4.3% from 4.4%, matching a 16-year low.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee voted to maintain record low interest rates, with the vote for no change coming in as expected. Governor, Mark Carney said Brexit is casting the biggest shadow over the U.K.’s economic outlook, as his confidence in an orderly departure from the European Union starts to fade.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Market Moves of the Week:</strong></p>\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-642 aligncenter\" src=\"http://strategiq.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Capture-4-August-2017.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"501\" height=\"542\" />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Chart of the Week:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_643\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"521\"]<img class=\"wp-image-643\" src=\"http://strategiq.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/UK-Policy.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"521\" height=\"383\" /> Source: Thomson Reuters.

On a full year basis, revenue grew 6% and diluted earnings per share increased 16% to $2.51/share. Results for the quarter came in above the markets expectations. Analyst consensus called for revenue of $8.63bn and $0.50 per share for the quarter, while reported revenue and earnings per share for the quarter were $8.68bn and $0.60 respectively.\r\n\r\nFootwear and apparel had the largest gains in revenue over the year with footwear climbing 6.09% to $21.01bn and apparel grew 6.47% to $9.65bn. Together footwear and apparel account for over 89% of the company’s revenue. Geographically, Greater China and Japan displayed the strongest top line growth of 11.94% and 16.69% respectively.\r\n\r\nTwo key themes have been identified as playing a vital role in Nike’s growth going forward. The themes are the following:\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li>Partnerships and Direct-to-consumer (DTC): Just recently Nike announced partnerships with both Amazon and Instagram. Nike will use Instagram-style posts to start selling their products directly through Instagram. Nike will also offer a product range on Amazon. These both benefit Nike as it opens them up to millions of more potential customers on both Amazon and Instagram as well as allowing Nike to leverage off Amazon’s distribution channels. Both partnerships tie into Nike’s effort to improve DTC revenue. This form of revenue tries to get products directly to the consumer in the most efficient way possible. An example of a DTC initiative paying dividends is a 30% increase in digital commerce sales for the period.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li value=\"2\">International Growth: Nike are continuing to expand internationally. This both diversifies their consumers and allows them to hedge the currency by earning in multiple countries. With increasing emerging market growth, there lies great opportunity for Nike to expand its products and take over global market share in the footwear and apparel markets. By expanding revenue out of the US Nike also benefit from a lower effective tax rate, allowing greater potential returns for shareholders.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<em>he information included above as well as individual companies and/or securities mentioned should not be construed as investment advice, a recommendation to buy or sell or an indication of trading intent on behalf of any Strategiq product.

Firstly,  SA CPI dipped to 5.1% year-on-year in June, a decrease of 0.3% from the previous CPI number. This is the lowest SA inflation has been since November 2015. Secondly, the South African Reserve Bank cut its key rate by 25 basis points, to 6.75%. This is the first time in the last five years that the SA central bank has cut borrowing costs. The decision was made on the back of the lower inflation numbers and the slow growth the SA economy faces.\r\n\r\nLocal retail stocks gained momentum over the week as the lower inflation numbers and interest rate cut put investor confidence back into the sector. Truworths (+7.04%), The Foschini Group (+7.43%) and Mr Price (+5.36%) were some of the retailers that benefited from the economic news.\r\n\r\nGlobal markets had a mixed week of returns. The Dow Jones (-0.27%) ended the week slightly weaker while the S&amp;P 500 (+0,54%), NASDAQ (+1.19%), FTSE 100 (1.01%) and TOPIX (+0.28%) all ended the week stronger.\r\n\r\nThe weakest return over the week was the STOXX 600, which eased 1.73% on the back of a stronger Euro. The Euro strengthened after the ECB left rates unchanged.\r\n\r\nIn other news, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has posted his first Instagram video: drone footage of Blue Origin\'s New Glenn rocket production facility. The video ends with the CEO on the roof holding a sign saying \"ROCKET FACTORY COMING SOON\". Blue Origin is Jeff Bezos\'s play at sending people to space at relatively low costs.

On a full year basis, revenue grew 6% and diluted earnings per share increased 16% to $2.51/share. Results for the quarter came in above the markets expectations. Analyst consensus called for revenue of $8.63bn and $0.50 per share for the quarter, while reported revenue and earnings per share for the quarter were $8.68bn and $0.60 respectively.\r\n\r\nFootwear and apparel had the largest gains in revenue over the year with footwear climbing 6.09% to $21.01bn and apparel grew 6.47% to $9.65bn. Together footwear and apparel account for over 89% of the company’s revenue. Geographically, Greater China and Japan displayed the strongest top line growth of 11.94% and 16.69% respectively.\r\n\r\nTwo key themes have been identified as playing a vital role in Nike’s growth going forward. The themes are the following:\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li>Partnerships and Direct-to-consumer (DTC): Just recently Nike announced partnerships with both Amazon and Instagram. Nike will use Instagram-style posts to start selling their products directly through Instagram. Nike will also offer a product range on Amazon. These both benefit Nike as it opens them up to millions of more potential customers on both Amazon and Instagram as well as allowing Nike to leverage off Amazon’s distribution channels. Both partnerships tie into Nike’s effort to improve DTC revenue. This form of revenue tries to get products directly to the consumer in the most efficient way possible. An example of a DTC initiative paying dividends is a 30% increase in digital commerce sales for the period.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li value=\"2\">International Growth: Nike are continuing to expand internationally. This both diversifies their consumers and allows them to hedge the currency by earning in multiple countries. With increasing emerging market growth, there lies great opportunity for Nike to expand its products and take over global market share in the footwear and apparel markets. By expanding revenue out of the US Nike also benefit from a lower effective tax rate, allowing greater potential returns for shareholders.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<em>The information included above as well as individual companies and/or securities mentioned should not be construed as investment advice, a recommendation to buy or sell or an indication of trading intent on behalf of any Strategiq product.

It is anticipated that the listing will be complete by the end of September, subject to market conditions. The African retail brands included in the Listing will comprise Pep in South Africa and the rest of Africa, Ackermans, Speciality division (comprising Dunns, John Craig, Refinery and Shoe City), JD Group (comprising Russells, Bradlows, Rochester, Sleepmasters, Incredible Connection and Hi-Fi Corporation), Steinbuild, Poco South Africa and Tekkie Town (the “African Assets”).\r\n\r\nThe rand fell to a new three-week low against the dollar on Friday as strong U.S. jobs data coupled with local economic and political risks dented investors\' appetite for the currency. The rand, trading at its weakest levels since July 12, has this week also been hit by fears of a third credit rating downgrade to \"junk\" ahead of review by Moody\'s on Aug. 11.\r\n\r\nThe market was also cautious ahead of a vote on a motion of no-confidence in President Jacob Zuma on Aug. 8. If the motion succeeds, Zuma and his entire cabinet would have to step down.\r\n\r\nOn the bourse, stocks ended higher with JSE All-Share index ending the week 1.93% stronger amid gains in Resources (+3.03%), Financials (+2.33%) and Industrials (+1.53%).\r\n\r\nIn the US, the stock market continues its positive momentum, as most of the companies reported better-than-expected earnings in the second quarter. On Wednesday, The Dow Jones climbed above 22,000 for the first time and closed at a record high on Friday.\r\n\r\nThe economic backdrop also remained positive as the economy added 209,000 jobs in July, higher than the expected 180,000, according to Bloomberg. The unemployment rate dropped to 4.3% from 4.4%, matching a 16-year low.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee voted to maintain record low interest rates, with the vote for no change coming in as expected.

PPC are open to reviewing any rival offers to the joint approach by Fairfax Financial Holdings and Afrisam Group. The acquisition would give Dangote a foothold outside of its home market of Nigeria.\r\n\r\nThe rand depreciated by 0.05% over the week relative to the dollar and by 1.80% to the British Pound.\r\n\r\nGlobally, markets all ended the week softer. Aside from the terrible impact hurricanes Harvey and Irma have had on human lives they have also had an impact on the U.S. economy. Jobless claims were reported at their highest level in the last two years. There were 62000 more applicants than the week before. This was attributed to the impact hurricane Harvey has had on workplaces and livelihoods. The US 10-year Treasury yields fell below 2,05% for the first time since November.  The Dow Jones (-0.86%), NASDAQ (-1.17%) and the S&amp;P 500 (-0.61%) all ended the weak softer.\r\n\r\nGlobal equity markets were also impacted but none more than the TOPIX which ended the week 1.61% weaker. The Mountain Day holiday which took place on Friday the 1st of September meant that markets were closed and prevented Japanese investors from responding to the increasing US – North Korean tension.\r\n\r\nIn currency markets the euro reached a two-and-a-half year high against the dollar. This was after ECB President Mario Draghi said that the ECB will have to take the euro’s strength into account when deciding to begin reducing its asset purchase program.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Market Moves of the Week:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_719\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"496\"]<img class=\"wp-image-719 size-full\" src=\"http://strategiq.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/PictureSeptember.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"496\" height=\"519\" /> Source: Thomson Reuters[/caption]\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Chart of the Week: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_720\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"952\"]<img class=\"wp-image-720 size-full\" src=\"http://strategiq.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CaptureSAGDP.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"952\" height=\"719\" /> South Africa GDP for the second quarter of the year was 2.5%, indicating the end to a technical recession.

The rand has fallen over 5% against the dollar since the start of last month.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. jobs report showed a fall in employment in September because of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, but a rise in wages could boost inflation and provide an argument for the Fed to tighten policy soon.\r\n\r\nThe unemployment rate fell to 4.2%, signalling that the labour market continues to operate at or below “full employment.” Wages grew by 2.9% year-over-year in September, the fastest pace since 2009 and a welcome increase over the 2.6% average wage growth over the past two years.\r\n\r\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May continued to feel the pressure at the Conservatives Party’s annual conference in Manchester this week. Sterling was set to deliver its worst weekly performance in a year after Mrs May’s speech sparked uncertainty over the prime minister’s future.\r\n\r\nTensions are running high in Spain with the ramifications of the referendum in Catalonia been felt in the Spanish equity and bond markets.

The two markets are responding to the currency movement over the week as a response to a lacklustre budget performance meeting which was held on Wednesday. The rand depreciated by 3.10% relative to the dollar for the week, making rand hedge industrials and resources an attractive trade. Financials (-1.82%) and SA Listed Property (-2.07%) were negatively impacted by the news over the week.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Locally, the highlight of the week was of course Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba’s maiden budget performance speech. Unfortunately, the budget performance did not leave anybody wanting to celebrate. South Africa GDP forecast was slashed to 0.7% from 1.3%, the projected revenue shortfall was higher than expected at R50.8bn widening the budget deficit from 3.1% to 4.3% in 2017 and debt-to-GDP is now estimated to increase to 60%, from 54% by 2022. Perhaps one of the most disappointing takeaways from the speech was that there doesn’t seem to be any considerable plan or measure to stimulate growth. There was no mention of tax hikes or plans for new tax hikes which leaves investors in the dark. Taking all of the above into account, the probability of a credit rating downgrade seems more likely. If the credit rating downgrade does take place, the market can expect a weaker rand, a possible interest rate hike to combat the rising inflation and overall, lower confidence in South Africa.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Market Moves of the Week:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_787\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"681\"]<img class=\"wp-image-787 size-full\" src=\"http://strategiq.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Picture1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"681\" height=\"712\" /> Source: Thomson Reuters[/caption]\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Globally, the majority of markets finished the week positively, the Dow Jones (+0.45%), S&amp;P 500 (+0.23%), NASDAQ (+1.09%), STOXX 600 (+0.85%) and the TOPIX (+2.33%) all ended the week in the green.

The fast growing technology group also beat on earnings by posting $0.52/share vs. the market expectation of $0.03/share.

Unfortunately, the budget performance did not leave anybody wanting to celebrate. South Africa GDP forecast was slashed to 0.7% from 1.3%, the projected revenue shortfall was higher than expected at R50.8bn widening the budget deficit from 3.1% to 4.3% in 2017 and debt-to-GDP is now estimated to increase to 60%, from 54% by 2022. Perhaps one of the most disappointing takeaways from the speech was that there doesn’t seem to be any considerable plan or measure to stimulate growth. There was no mention of tax hikes or plans for new tax hikes which leaves investors in the dark. Taking all of the above into account, the probability of a credit rating downgrade seems more likely.
